**Use the below command:**

<Box marginBottom={4}>`rm -rf lampp`</Box>

It deletes all files and folders contained in the `lampp` directory.

**In case user doesnâ€™t have the permission to delete the folder:**

Add `sudo` at the beginning of the command:

<Box marginBottom={4}>`sudo rm -rf folderName`</Box>

Note: This assumes you are already at the same level in the terminal as the folder you want to delete. If not:

<Box marginBottom={4}>`sudo rm -r /path/to/folderName`</Box>

FYI: You can use the following options:

- `-f` = to ignore non-existent files and never prompt
- `-r` = to remove directories and their contents recursively
- `-v` = to display what is being done
